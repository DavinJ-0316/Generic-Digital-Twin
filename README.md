# Generic-Digital-Twin
Generic Digital Twin: A combination of IoT and 3D platform where you can choose customised scenarios such as Smart Building, Smart Farm, and Crab Camera. In addition, you can also add 3D components such as sensor, section, object, etc.


- You can choose different scenarios under the File button.


- You can clear all the content by clicking the Refresh button.


- Please note that before you swicth between different scenarios (Smart Building, Smart Farm, Crab Camera), please click the Refresh button.


- You can add 3D elements by clicking Add button.


- You can also view the IoT sensor information by clicking Graph button.

- Press ctrl and - (or ctrl and scroll down) to reset the resolution if the menubar is not working properly

# Sensors

- Office rooms: The v110 and v111 are equipped with light sensors, and the v159 and v154 are equipped with temperature sensors and PIR sensors (person in the room)

- Common rooms: The v116, v131, and entrance are equipped with temperature sensors and PIR sensors (person in the room)

- Changing color to red means warm, Changing color to red means blue means cold

- Changing color to white means bright, Changing color to grey means blue means dark

- Small green ball means there is someone in the room at that moment


# Different prediction rate:

- You can adjust the prediction percentage by adding ?forecast_len_ratio=0.1 or ?forecast_len_ratio=0.2 or ?forecast_len_ratio=0.3

- 10% prediction: https://davinj-0316.github.io/Generic-Digital-Twin/?forecast_len_ratio=0.1

- 20% prediction: By default

- 30% prediction: https://davinj-0316.github.io/Generic-Digital-Twin/?forecast_len_ratio=0.3
